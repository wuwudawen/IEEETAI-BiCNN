## BiCNN_Training.py
This script shows how to construct the BiCNN model introduced in Section 3, and how to train BiCNN models using the training algorithm proposed in Section4.

## Bimatrix_game_generation.py
This script shows how to generate a bimatrix game used for training. It implement the LH algorithm described in Section 2.2
